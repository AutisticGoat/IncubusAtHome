# Incubus at home:
"Incubus At Home" is a stupid, stinky, and janky library I coded and pooped out of my butt in just a few days. It was made from pure boredom.
This library is an installable version of the Dynamic Minisaacs Forever! mod, inspired by KittenChilly's Dynamic Minisaac Tears mod, and programmed by me.

## HOW DO I USE THIS THING???

Don't, until I fix this thing. I'm sorry.
